** Clock sources, controlled by SYSCTRL
** GCLK, control clock distribution system
   GCLK 0 generates GCLK_MAIN.
** PM generates and controls the synchronous clocks
* Synchronous and Asyncronous Clock 
  * SYNCBUSY 
  * Sync Clocks :: CPU and bus clocks
  * async clocks :: GCLK
* Register sync
** common sync
  * common sync register sync :: GCLK, WDT, RTC, EIC, TC, ADC, AC, DAC
       The common sysnhronizer is used for all registers in one peripheral.Therefore,status register(STATUS) of each peripheral can be sync at a time.
   * Write-sync
     
** distributed sync
  * distributed sync register sync :: SERCOM USART/SPI/I2C, I2S, TCC, USB
       Regiseters that need sync have their individual SYNCBUSY bits.
